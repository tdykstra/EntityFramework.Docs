# Entity Framework Core tools eference - .NET CLI

The Entity Framework Core command-line interface (CLI) tools perform design-time tasks. For example, they create migrations, apply migrations, and scaffold a model based on an existing database. The commands are an extension to the cross-platform [dotnet](/dotnet/core/tools) command, which is part of the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).

If you're using Visual Studio, we recommend [the Package Manager Console tools](powershell.md) instead:
* They automatically work with the current project selected in the **Package Manager Console** without requiring that you manually switch directories.
* They automatically open files generated by a command after the command is completed.

## Installing the tools

How you install the tools differs depending on whether you're using EF Core 2.x or 1.x.

### For apps that use EF Core 2.0 and later

* Install the current [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core). The SDK has to be installed even if you have the latest version of Visual Studio 2017.

  This is all that is needed for ASP.NET Core 2.1+ because the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design` package is included in the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.App metapackage](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/metapackage-app).

* For ASP.NET Core 2.0 and earlier, or other project types:

  Install the latest stable `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design` package. 

  ``` Console	
  dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design	
  ```

### For apps that use EF Core 1.0 or 1.1

* Install the .NET Core SDK version 2.1.200. Later versions are not compatible with CLI tools for EF Core 1.0 and 1.1.

* Configure the application to use the 2.1.200 SDK version by modifying its [global.json](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-json) file. This file is normally included in the solution directory (one above the project). 

* Edit the project file and add `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet` as a `DotNetCliToolReference` item. Specify the latest 1.x version, for example: 1.1.6. See the project file example at the end of this section.

* Install the latest 1.x version of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design` package, for example:

  ```console
  dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design -v 1.1.6
  ```

* Run the following commands to verify that EF Core CLI tools are correctly installed and configured:

  ``` Console
  dotnet restore
  dotnet ef
  ```

With both package references added, the project file looks something like this:

``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design"
                      Version="1.1.6"
                      PrivateAssets="All" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet"
                            Version="1.1.6" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

A package reference with `PrivateAssets="All"` isn't exposed to projects that reference this project. This restriction is especially useful for packages that are typically only used during development.

## Using the tools

Before using the tools:
* Understand the difference between target and startup project.
* Learn how to use the tools with .NET Standard class libraries.
* For ASP.NET Core projects, set the environment.

### Target and startup project

Whenever you invoke a command, there are two projects involved:

* The *target project* is where any files are added (or in some cases removed). The target project defaults to the project in the current directory, but can be changed using the <nobr>**`--project`**</nobr> option.

* The *startup project* is the one emulated by the tools when executing your project's code. It also defaults to the project in the current directory, but can be changed using the <nobr>**`--startup-project`**</nobr> option.

For instance, here's a command to update the database of a web application that has EF Core installed in a different project. In this example, *WebProj* and *EFCoreProj* are projects at the same folder level. The command prompt is running in the *WebProj* folder.


```console
dotnet ef database update --project ./EFCoreProj
```

### .NET Standard class libraries

If your project targets a framework other than .NET Core (for example, Universal Windows Platform or Xamarin), you have to use a .NET Standard class library for EF Core. In that case, you need to use a startup project that targets .NET Core so that the tooling has a concrete target platform into which it can load your class library. This startup project can be a dummy project with no real code--it is only needed to provide a target for the tooling.

If your project targets .NET Core, you don't have to use a .NET Standard class library. In that case you can use a .NET Core class library and it will be easier to work with the EF Core tools.

### ASP.NET Core environment

To specify the environment for ASP.NET Core projects, set the **ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT** environment variable before running commands

## Common options

|    |  Option                                | Description                            |

## dotnet ef database update

Updates the database to the last migration or to a specified migration.

Arguments:

| Argument |Description |
|:-------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<MIGRATION>` | The target migration. Migrations may be identified by name or by ID. The number 0 is a special case that means *before the first migration* and causes all migrations to be reverted. If no migration is specified, the command defaults to the last migration. |

The following examples update the database to a specified migration:

```powershell
dotnet ef database update InitialCreate

```

### dotnet ef dbcontext info

Gets information about a `DbContext` type.

### dotnet ef dbcontext list

Lists available `DbContext` types.

### dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold

Scaffolds a `DbContext` and entity types for a database.

Arguments:

| Argument |Description |
|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<CONNECTION>` | The connection string to the database. For ASP.NET Core 2.x projects, the value can be *name=\<name of connection string>*. In that case the name comes from the configuration sources that are set up for the project. |
| `<PROVIDER>`   | The provider to use. Typically this is the name of the NuGet package, for example: `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`. |

Options:

|| Option |Description |
|:----------------|:----------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <nobr>-d</nobr> | `--data-annotations`                      | Use attributes to configure the model (where possible). If this option is omitted, only the fluent API is used. |
| -c              | `--context <NAME>`                       | The name of the `DbContext` class to generate.                                                                       |
|                 | `--context-dir <PATH>`                   | The directory to put the `DbContext` class file in. Paths are relative to the project directory. Namespaces are derived from the folder names.             |
| -f              | `--force`                                 | Overwrite existing files.                                                                        |

| -t              | `--table <TABLE_NAME>`...                | The tables to generate entity types for. To specify multiple tables, repeat the `-t` or `--table` for each one. If this option is omitted, all tables are included.                                                         |
|                 | `--use-database-names`                    | Use table and column names exactly as they appear in the database. If this option is omitted, database names are changed to more closely conform to C# name style conventions. |

Example:

```console
dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Server=(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Database=Blogging;Trusted_Connection=True;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -o Models
